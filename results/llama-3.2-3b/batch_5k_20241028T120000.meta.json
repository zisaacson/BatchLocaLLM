Non-technical degrees are weaker, even at strong schools.\n\n**Company Pedigree**\n\u2022 Brand and caliber of employers (tier-1 tech, high-growth startups, selective teams, notable acquisitions).\n\n**Trajectory**\n\u2022 Speed and consistency of promotions relative to years of experience.\n\u2022 Engineers with >8 years should typically be \u2265 Senior SWE.\n\u2022 Engineers with >12 years should typically be \u2265 Staff SWE.\n\u2022 Faster than these milestones = stronger trajectory. Slower = weaker trajectory.\n\n**Is Software Engineer**\n\u2022 Confirm titles and responsibilities are software engineering.\n\nReturn a concise recommendation and rationales.
